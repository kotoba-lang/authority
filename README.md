# authority

**The capability lattice that `capability-semantics.edn` specifies.** Scopes as
segment paths, `covers?` as a partial order, `meet` as attenuation — and every
authority string already on the wire in this fleet as a rendering of it.

Portable `.cljc`, zero runtime dependencies, no crypto. Runs on the JVM and in
a Cloudflare Worker from the same source.

```clojure
(require '[authority.scope :as scope]
         '[authority.grant :as grant]
         '[authority.chain :as chain])

(chain/authorize
  {:chain     [(grant/grant {:scopes ["kotoba://graph/*"]  :expires "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z"})
               (grant/grant {:scopes ["kotoba://graph/g1"] :holder "did:key:zBob"})]
   :requested "kotoba://graph/g1"
   :holder    "did:key:zBob"
   :now       "2026-08-15T00:00:00Z"})
;; => {:authority/allowed?  true
;;     :authority/reason    :granted
;;     :authority/effective {:grant/scopes #{["kotoba" "graph" "g1"]}
;;                           :grant/expires "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z" …}
;;     :authority/attempts  []
;;     :authority/depth     2}
```

## Why this exists

Every capability check in the fleet asks the same question — does what the
holder was granted cover what they are asking for — and it is written once per
URI scheme, each time as a string equality with a trailing-`*` special case.
Measured 2026-08-15, that is **eight schemes**:

```
kotoba://can/ (180)   kotoba://graph/ (91)   kotoba://op/ (27)
kotoba://org/ (18)    kotoba://cap/ (17)     kotoba://authority/ (3)
kotoba://tenant/ (1)  kotoba-rad://<rid>/push/<ref>
```

That shape has a failure mode it cannot see. `cacao.core/covers?` strips the
`*` and calls `starts-with?`:

```clojure
(covers? "kotoba://graph/alice*" "kotoba://graph/alice-evil")  ;=> true
```

Today's minters happen to always place the `*` after a `/`, so the hazard is
latent rather than live. But it is latent **in the comparison**, which means
every future minter has to hold an invariant by hand that nothing checks. Here
a scope is `["kotoba" "graph" "alice"]`, segments compare by `=`, and there is
no substring left to confuse. Prefix confusion is not rejected — it is
unrepresentable.

`authority.scope-test/a-wildcard-cannot-confuse-a-prefix` pins both directions:
the confusing pair is refused, and the genuine wildcard still reaches it.

## The theorem

    effective = meet(link₀, link₁, … linkₙ)

`meet` is the greatest lower bound of `covers?`, so the fold is covered by
every link **by construction**. A link claiming more than its parent does not
have to be rejected for the result to be safe — it contributes nothing,
because there is no value the fold could produce that some link did not
already grant.

`cacao.core/verify-chain` instead *checks* each pair and reports the leaf's
resources as effective. That is correct while every pair verified, and one
forgotten branch away from not being. Here escalation is arithmetically
absent, and `:authority/attempts` still reports every attempt — safety from
the algebra, evidence from the report, neither standing in for the other.

### A gap this closes on the way

`cacao.core/link-problems` compares expiries only `(when (and (:exp parent)
(:exp child)))`, so a child link carrying **no** `exp` under a bounded parent
is never reported. Here an absent bound is `+∞` and `meet` takes the minimum,
so an unbounded child cannot extend a bounded parent — and `grant/escalation`
reports the attempt anyway.

## The wire does not change

`render` reproduces the existing strings byte for byte and `parse` accepts
them, so adopting this is a **replacement for the comparison, not a migration
of the tokens**. All eight schemes round-trip; see
`authority.scope-test/the-wire-round-trips-byte-for-byte`.

## Fail-closed, without a sentinel

There is no `::denied` value. A grant reaching nothing is the empty antichain,
and `covered?` on it is false through the ordinary code path rather than a
special case — `nil` punning to *allow* is how a missing policy becomes a
public database, and a sentinel is only safe while every caller remembers to
test for it.

Consequently:

| input | result |
|---|---|
| unparseable resource string | not a scope; `parse-all` reports it in `:rejected` |
| empty chain | `grant/nothing`, reason `:empty-chain` |
| no trusted clock | denied, reason `:expired-or-no-trusted-time` |
| holder mismatch | denied, reason `:wrong-holder` |
| in scope, live, right holder | `:granted` |

A caller that ignores `:rejected` is **narrowed**, never widened.

## What this does not do

**It does not authenticate anything.** No signature is verified, no key is
read, and no parent-audience → child-issuer linkage is checked. Those belong
to `cacao.core/verify-chain`. A fold of unverified links is a fold of whatever
the presenter wrote.

This boundary is stated in `authority.chain`'s own docstring as well, because
a library that looks like the check and is not on the path where the check
happens is exactly the gap the superproject found in `kotobase.guarded`.

## Boundary with the nearest repositories

| repo | question it answers |
|---|---|
| **authority** (here) | how much authority does this grant confer, and does it reach what is asked |
| `kotoba-lang/policy` | do this subject's attributes satisfy a rule (ABAC/RBAC, combining algorithms) |
| `kotoba-lang/authorization` | request → decision facade, with a durable decision ledger |
| `org-chainagnostic-cacao` | is this token genuine, unexpired and unreplayed (CAIP-122 / SIWE, Ed25519) |
| `kotoba-lang/security` | fleet-wide assurance controls: ABAC, information flow, one-shot effect grants |

`policy` decides from attributes; this decides from *held authority*, and the
two compose — a policy may narrow a grant, never widen it, which is `meet`.

## Complexity

`covers?` is O(depth) with early exit. `meet-sets` is O(|a|·|b|) before
normalisation, and normalisation keeps grants as antichains — a handful of
scopes in practice — so a delegation chain folds in time linear in its length.
No allocation on the deny path.

## Pure Kotoba: `authority.lattice`

[`src/authority/lattice.kotoba`](src/authority/lattice.kotoba) is the same
lattice for a Kotoba guest (root ADR-2610082200 §16: everything below the
kotoba app runs in pure Kotoba). `authority.scope` stays as the general oracle,
the way kotoba-lang/text keeps `text.cljk` beside `bounded_text.kotoba`.

It works on the resource string itself (`kotoba://graph/g1`), because a scope
vector mixes string segments with the keyword `:*` and a Kotoba vector holds
one type; `parse` and `render` are inverses on every valid scope, so nothing is
lost. `valid?`, `covers?`, `meet` (`""` when incomparable) and `covered?` keep
the oracle's laws. It needs only `kotoba.lang.bounded-text`, so `deps.edn` pins
kotoba-lang/text at a commit that has it.

```bash
kbb --backend sci --classpath "src:$(kbb -Spath)" scripts/lattice-oracle-cases.cljk
```

asks `authority.scope` every question the Kotoba tests assert (37 cases on
2026-10-09, all agree). The tests themselves run on Wasm:
`kotoba -M compile src/authority/lattice.kotoba --source-path src ... --target
wasm32-browser --fuel 1000000`, then each `test-*` export in a fresh instance
(8/8). `kotoba -M test` stops on the js target (`unsupported KIR node`) and the
native targets do not yet qualify typed string sets.

### `authority.delegation`

[`src/authority/delegation.kotoba`](src/authority/delegation.kotoba) is
`authority.chain/authorize` for a guest, on top of `authority.lattice`. It
answers the same reason in the same order (1 granted … 6 out-of-scope, plus 7
for a malformed chain). A chain is three typed maps keyed 0..n-1 — scope sets,
holders, expiries — because a list of records is outside the value profile and
`[:list T]` has no count. It never builds a meet of sets: scopes form a tree,
so the meet of every link covers a request exactly when every link covers it.

```bash
kbb --backend sci --classpath "src:$(kbb -Spath)" scripts/delegation-oracle-cases.cljk
```

asks the oracle the same 22 questions (all agree, 2026-10-09). On Wasm the five
`test-*` pass with `--fuel 5000000`.

## Test

```bash
kbb -M:test                       # 37 tests, 122 assertions (JVM)
kbb --backend sci --classpath src test/cljs_smoke.cljk   # the same laws under ClojureScript
```

The order laws (reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, greatest-lower-bound)
are enumerated exhaustively over a twelve-scope universe — 144 pairs, 1,728
triples — rather than sampled, and the fold theorem over all 343 three-link
chains. A property that holds here holds because it was checked.

Both discriminating mutations were run against a broken copy and produced
exactly the intended failure and no other:

| mutation | test that failed |
|---|---|
| segment compare → `starts-with?` (restores the `cacao` semantics) | `a-wildcard-cannot-confuse-a-prefix` |
| absent child bound → unbounded (restores the `link-problems` gap) | `an-unbounded-child-cannot-outlive-a-bounded-parent`, `the-tightest-expiry-in-the-chain-wins-wherever-it-sits` |

## Migrating the decision core to `.kotoba`

`scope/covers?` is a pure decision over two sequences of segments — the shape
the superproject's decision-core rule asks for. It is `.cljc` today because
its consumers are `.cljc` (`kotobase`, `security`, `nekko`) and `.cljs` (the
edge Worker), and the collection layer (`normalize`, `meet-sets`) is exactly
the part that rule says stays behind.

The blocker for the pairwise core is `kotoba-kir`'s native admission gate,
which is word-typed: a scope is a sequence of strings, so it qualifies on
`:compiler` / `:kotoba-wasm` / `:kotoba-cljs` but not `:native-aot`. That is a
backend gap, not a language ceiling — do not read this note as a design
constraint.

Written to make the move cheap: no atoms, no host interop, no exceptions on
the decision path, and every failure already a value.
