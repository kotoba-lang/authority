(ns authority.scope
  "Authority as a value in a lattice, not a string in a comparison.

  Every capability check in this fleet is the same question — does what the
  holder was granted cover what they are asking for — and it is written once
  per URI scheme, each time as a string equality with a trailing-`*` special
  case. That shape has a failure mode it cannot see. `cacao.core/covers?`
  strips the `*` and calls `starts-with?`, so

      kotoba://graph/alice*   covers   kotoba://graph/alice-evil

  Today's minters happen to always put the `*` after a `/`, so the hazard is
  latent rather than live. But it is latent in the *comparison*, which means
  every future minter has to keep an invariant by hand that nothing checks.

  A scope here is a vector of segments. The same grant is
  `[\"kotoba\" \"graph\" \"alice\"]`, segments compare by `=`, and there is
  no substring left to confuse. Prefix confusion is not rejected; it is
  unrepresentable.

  **The wire format does not change.** `render` reproduces the existing
  strings byte for byte and `parse` accepts them, so adopting this is a
  replacement for the comparison, not a migration of the tokens. All eight
  schemes measured in the fleet on 2026-08-15 round-trip:

      kotoba://can/…  kotoba://graph/…  kotoba://op/…  kotoba://org/…
      kotoba://cap/…  kotoba://authority/…  kotoba://tenant/…
      kotoba-rad://<rid>/push/<ref>

  ## The order

  `covers?` is a partial order over scopes and `meet` is its greatest lower
  bound. Attenuation is therefore not a rule that delegation obeys — it is
  the only thing `meet` can produce. See `authority.chain`.

  ## Bottom is the empty set, not a sentinel

  There is no `::denied` value. A grant that reaches nothing is a scope set
  with no members, and `covered?` on it is false through the ordinary code
  path rather than a special case. This is deliberate: `nil` punning to
  \"allow\" is how a missing policy becomes a public database, and a
  sentinel is only safe while every caller remembers to test for it."
